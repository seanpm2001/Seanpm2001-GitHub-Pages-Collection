Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NimbleBit-Glossary/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# NimbleBit-Glossary
A glossary of NimbleBit terms from NimbleBit games.

***

## About

See above. This is an article project that aims to be a glossary of terms used in the video games and culture of the NimbleBit LLC mobile video game company.

The glossary itself is located directly below the horizontal line divider below the current sentence.

***

## NimbleBit glossary

Here is a glossary of NimbleBit terms:

**Angry birds in the Air vent** - A reference from BitBook referring to the past mobile video game Angry Birds, which no longer exists officially on the Apple App store or Google Play store (as Rovio, the creator, took it down in 2017)

**Bux** - A digital premium currency in NimbleBit games used to purchase powerful upgrades, and speed up actions/tasks.

**Bitizen** - A small pixelated person that lives in your city/tower.

**BitBook** - A social media platform for your Bitizens

**BrickBook** - A social media platform for your bitizens (only in Lego Tower)

**Chips** - The currency commonly earned in Tiny Tower Vegas that lets you play Casino games.

**Coins** - The common currency in NimbleBit games used for most actions.

**Costume** - Dress up your bitizens with costumes. You can earn costumes by delivering a Bitizen that wears them, or buy them for 10 bux (or 5 bux, depending on which version of the game you are playing0

**Cybertruck** - A truck created by the electric car manufacturing company Tesla that has a very blocky appearance and started at $39,000. It was referenced a day after the vehicle was announced via BitBook via Tiny Tower.

**FPS** - Floors per second, applies to elevators. The modern versions of the game start with 1 floor per second speed, and through over 90000 bux worth of upgrades, you can reach a max of 10 floor per second speed.

**GT**, **Golden Ticket** - Golden ticket, a special item in Tiny Tower won through an hourly raffle, or through destroying 50 floors of your tower (requires resetting your tower) that lets you max out a floor, and get free, instant restocking. This item stays with you permanently, but unfortunately, cannot be purchased (as of August 10th 2021)

**Holonet** - A social media platform for your bitizens (only in Star Wars: Tiny Death Star)

**Imperial Bux** - A variant of the Bux currency in the Star Wars: Tiny Death Star video game

**PPM** - An old measure for elevator speeds, where each elevator upgrade had to be done through a load of bux, and it would force change its appearance and speed (you originally couldn't choose the appearance of the elevator)

**Series of tubes** - An Internet meme term referring to the Internet, from the (non-NimbleBit) video titled "The Internet series of tubes" which is a modified rant of (unknown_person) saying that the Internet is a **series of tubes, and not a truck you dump something on** (reference used on NimbleBit website)

**Sky burger** - A game referenced in most NimbleBit games, which is a reference to the NimbleBit game Sky Burger, where you use tilt or touch controls to create a burger as large as possible.

**Untitled Zoo** - A reference to the video game "Untitled Goose game" that is referenced in Disco Zoo as a quest to find a goose "that escaped from Untitled Zoo"

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
