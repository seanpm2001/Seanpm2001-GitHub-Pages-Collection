Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_AndrOpen-Office/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# CompuSmell
The designs and concepts for CompuSmell, a hardware project for disaster proof computer storage and equipment safety. 

***

## About

See above and below for more info.

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/CompuSmell/wiki/)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## History

[Organization link (GitHub)](https://github.com/CompuSmell/)

This project has had a long development history so far for not being functional yet.

### SNU Smell Project

[Repository link (GitHub)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_SmellProject/)

This project originated as the SNU Smell Project, which had the same motive as all 3 variants so far: to bring odor emission to computing through programmable smells/odor.

This variant didn't make it very far, and was succeeded by the SNU CompuSmell project.

### SNU CompuSmell

[Repository link (GitHub)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_CompuSmell/)

The SNU CompuSmell project was a successor to the SNU Smell Project, which was inspired by a rescue animal I cared for this month named Cobie, who really liked to smell things and enjoy the outdoors. This variant was dedicated to him.

This variant made it a bit further, and better defined some of the motives, but didn't improve the project very much overall. It was later succeeded in 2021 by the CompuSmell project, as it was separated from the SNU project.

### CompuSmell-Project

[(Coming soon)Repository link (GitHub)](https://github.com/CompuSmell/)

The 3rd variant of the CompuSmell project was introduced in 2021 as a separation of the project from the SNU project directly. This variant is still under development, and the hardware to omit odor like this has not been invented yet.

***

## Samples

As of milestone 3 of this project, the following smell libraries have been defined:

### Nature

• Raspberry bush

• Dirt

• Blueberry bush

### Perfume

• None

### Industrial

• Heated CPU air

• Gasoline (safe)

• Smoke (safe)

### Aquatic

• Misty air

Note: the industrial smells marked as safe are highly experimental ways of producing a non-dangerous gasoline and smoke odor. The usage of fire or gasoline will not be required, as this is designed to be an eco-friendly project. It is designed to be non-hazardous to the health of those who smell or, and the environment.

The smells have some pros and cons:

### Pros

• It can provide more immersive VR experiences (i.e: making misty smells when playing a water game)

• It can make Online perfume shops a thing

• It is something new that is fun to do with computers

### Cons that need to be worked on

• A hijacker can start putting out bad smells, or put out smells when they aren't wanted

• You might go noseblind due to overuse

The project is written in the VSmell programming language, which is a language designed for odor programming. Its syntax was inspired by JavaScript and Python.

Here is a hello world program written in VSmell:

```javascript
function sayHelloWorld {
	print.console("Hello world");
}
sayHelloWorld();
```

Here is the first odor program made in the language:

```python
import scent.garden // The garden scent library
function playInTheGarden {
scent.spray("RaspberryBush.snint") [ (strength=10%) for { 0.1 second_s } ]; // snint is a portmanteau that means scent/sniff, it is a unique keyword for the language
scent.stop(all);
}
for x in range(1, 43) {
f.playInTheGarden();
}
#EOF // This is a required line
```

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
