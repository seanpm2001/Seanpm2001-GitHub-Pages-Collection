# My GitHub Pages release model

## For testing features

When I test website features in GitHub pages, I go through a testing process. Here is my release model for testing and releasing new changes

### Alpha

The first attempts at testing the feature go into the Alpha site build, located at [seanwallawalla-testing.github.io](https://github.com/seanwallawalla-testing/seanwallawalla-testing.github.io/) if successful, they will build and launch at [https://seanwallawalla-testing.github.io/](https://seanwallawalla-testing.github.io/)

If the feature is successful, it goes onto the beta stage.

### Beta

The feature is refined and improved in the beta phase, and all bugs are squashed. This site build is located at [seanpm2001-testing.github.io](https://github.com/seanpm2001-testing/seanpm2001-testing.github.io/) if successful, they will build and launch at [https://seanpm2001-testing.github.io/](https://seanpm2001-testing.github.io/)

If the feature is still successful, it will start going into all my other GitHub pages projects when needed and when ready.

### Full release

Once the changes pass in Alpha and Beta phases, they will start going into all my other GitHub pages projects when needed and when ready.
