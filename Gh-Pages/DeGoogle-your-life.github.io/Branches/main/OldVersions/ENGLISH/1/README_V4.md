## Basic description

[From Wikipedia: Degoogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle)

The DeGoogle movement (also called the de-Google movement) is a grassroots campaign that has spawned as privacy activists urge users to stop using Google products entirely due to growing privacy concerns regarding the company. The term refers to the act of removing Google from one's life. As the growing market share of the internet giant creates monopolistic power for the company in digital spaces, increasing numbers of journalists have noted the difficulty to find alternatives to the company's products.

**History**

In 2013, John Koetsier of Venturebeat said Amazon's Kindle Fire Android-based tablet was "a de-Google-ized version of Android." In 2014 John Simpson of US News wrote about the “right to be forgotten” by Google and other search engines. In 2015, Derek Scally of Irish Times wrote an article on how to "De-Google your life." In 2016 Kris Carlon of Android Authority suggested that users of CyanogenMod 14 could “de-Google” their phones, because CyanogenMod works fine without Google apps too. In 2018 Nick Lucchesi of Inverse wrote about how ProtonMail was promoting how to "be able to completely de-Google-fy your life.” Lifehacker's Brendan Hesse wrote a detailed tutorial on "quitting Google." Gizmodo journalist Kashmir Hill claims that she missed meetings and had difficulties organizing meet ups without the use of Google Calendar. In 2019, Huawei gave a refund to phone owners in the Philippines who were inhibited from using services provided by Google because so few alternatives exist that the absence of the company's products made normal internet use unfeasible.

Privacy on Google products is always bad, due to all Google products containing spyware.

No matter what you do, when you are using Google, all of your sensitive personal data is being sent to Google and others. Google has also been spotted going through open programs. For example, from personal experience (on Firefox) with a YouTube tab open that I didn't visit, I watched several videos offline (VLC Media Player) Later when I went to check the recommendations, it was nearly everything that I had watched. There is no doubt they are spying on other programs too.

In Chrome (and many other browsers) an incognito mode is present. In Chrome, this mode is pointless, as Google will still mine your data. Even if you turn data mining/tracking off, and enable the "do not track" signal, surprise suprise, Google is still mining your data.

If you think you have nothing to hide, **you are absolutely wrong**. This argument has been debunked many times over:

[Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#Criticism)

1. Edward Snowden remarked "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."

2. Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."

3. Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security." He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion.

4. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual. Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."

5. Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.

6. Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.

7. Julian Assange stated "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."

8. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination.

## Countering other arguments

There are some arguments people make to justify Google. One of the first major one is already debunked [here](#Privacy) but here are some other ones:

### Convenience

Yes, Google products seem convenient. However, you are trading everything good for convenience, including security, privacy, and reliability. Google has been getting lazier over the years, and their servers have gone down more and more. Right now, the Google servers go down for nearly an hour 1-2 times per month (most notably YouTube)

Unfortunately, due to societies reliance on Google, Google has come to dominate the Internet, and is seeking to control more and more. In 2012, when Google went down for 5 minutes, it was reported that **global** Internet traffic **dropped by 40%** Google frequently goes down for 1-2 hours, and with the [firing of their ethics team](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/google-fires-top-ai-ethics-researcher-margaret-mitchell/) among other things, they are going to become less and less convenient.

Convenience isn't always a good thing. You should be aware of what is going on and be prepared for when they go down, as there isn't a way to have a server not go down every once in a while.

Google also isn't as convenient as you think. There are other much more convenient sites. Google is far from convenient, when you account their random account suspensions and terminations with no response (unless you draw enough attention to the Google twitter account or sue them for $100,000,000 or more) then they have taken advantage of you, screwed you over, and forced you to scream into a pillow, where no-one could hear your screams for help.

### Why does it matter, its too late anyways

This is a less common argument, but it needs explanation. With the current state, most world governments, along with several powerful corporations seem to know your every move, so why even bother to get away from it? The answer is simple: **you deserve better**. If you manage to get away from them at this point, it is harder for them to track your moves further, and you can build a new more private life.

[1 source](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/huk4rp/why_you_should_degoogle_intro_degoogling/) By the way, I have been giving my free Reddit award to this post every time I get it for over a week now (along with all 500 of my free coins) to boost this topic up further. So far, I have given this post over 14 free awards. It isn't much, but small things can make a big impact, depending on how it is perceived, and by whom.

### Other

I don't have any other arguments at the moment.

## My degoogling experience

I finally started to see the problems with big tech in 2018, and I began degoogling. In the first few months, I made significant progress. It slowed down immensely since then.


### What I switched from

Google Chrome -> Firefox/Tor

Google Search -> DuckDuckGo (default)/Ecosia (when I feel like it)/Bing (rarely)

GMail - ProtonMail (not yet fully switched)

Google Sites -> Self hosting (not yet fully switched)

Google+ -> Hardly ever used, deleted itself due to its own shutdown

Google Docs -> Never used, I just use Microsoft Word 2013 (before 2019) and LibreOffice (2019-onward) instead.

Google Sheets -> Never used, I just use Microsoft Excel 2013 (before 2019) and LibreOffice (2019-onward) instead.

Google Slides -> Never used, I just use Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 (before 2019) and LibreOffice (2019-onward) instead.

Google Drawings -> Never used, I just use LibreOffice (2019-onward) instead.

Gerrit -> Never ussed, I just use GitHub (current default), GitLab, BitBucket, and SourceForge instead.

Google Photos -> Never used

Google Drive -> OneDrive (2019-2020) Degoo (2020-2020) pCloud (2020-present)

Google Maps -> OpenStreetMaps/Apple Maps

Go - Making a special exception, but not using as a functional programming language

Dart - Making a special exception, but not using as a functional programming language

Flutter - Making a special exception, but not using as a functional programming language

Google Earth -> OpenStreetMaps/Apple Maps

Google Streetview -> Never used, I find it extra creepy

Google Fi -> Never used

Google Calendar -> Never used

Google calculator -> Literally any other calculator app, even a Linux terminal running in Python mode if I feel like it

Google Nest -> Never used

Google AMP -> Never used

Google VPN -> Never used, also an oxymoron

Google Pay -> Never used

Google Summer of Code -> Never participated

Tenor -> Other GIF sites, although GIFs aren't too important to me. I normally get GIF files from DuckDuckGo images, Imgur, Reddit, or other sites.

Blockly -> No longer used, not sure if Scratch directly ran blockly. I became a functional programmer in 2017 onward, and grew out of Scratch.

GBoard -> Used once, but abandoned

Google Glass -> Never used, considered as a young child but decided not to get one/use one if I had the option

_List may be incomplete._

### Products I still cannot get away from

As of February 25th 2021, these are the Google products that are keeping me from fully degoogling:

1. YouTube

2. Android

3. Google Play Store

4. GMail (only for school and some sites)

5. Google Classroom (only for school)

6. Google Translate

7. Google Account

8. Google Sites (as Google is violating the laws of the GDPR (and can face another €5,000,000.00 fine until they get it fixed) and forbidding downloads of this product)

I have degoogled from everything else.
