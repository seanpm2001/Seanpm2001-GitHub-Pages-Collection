SourceBase is a set of web templates for use of creating web pages and websites quickly, without writing the entire skeleton from scratch. This normally takes me over 20 minutes. With SourceBase, the time is cut down significantly.

**SourceBase currently is accepting limited contributions**

To modify the project, you have to create a new file with the contents of the previous file. Each template has its own set of rules

Let's start with the HTML template:

SourceBase HTML dev
-----------

This is the most common template that is used. For the normal HTML version, some changes have to be made every update, such as dating the build (it is commented at the bottom) and making an important change (something you would want to start a page with)

The templates should remain small, and should never exceed 256 kilobytes in size (this rule may change in the future) the document also must be as light as possible, and be compliant with the HTML DOM [read more about that here](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)

This means that the template MUST work in DOM compliant browsers (Such as Mozilla Firefox) and not work on just a single browser (IE, Chrome, etc.) I always test with Firefox, but tests should also be done in other browsers.

If your addition isn't important enough to be in the official master template, it can easily be remixed into your own template. With this, you can make templates that are specifically designed for a certain task.

SourceBase XHTML dev
-----------

Currently, the XHTML template is having problems. I am not sure how to get it completely compliant (even the first version) contributions can be made here, but they should not alter the contents of the page, but instead, work to achieve complaince.

These versions also must be spun off into different Beta releases until it reaches 100% compliance. The other same rules for the HTML template also apply to the XHTML template.
