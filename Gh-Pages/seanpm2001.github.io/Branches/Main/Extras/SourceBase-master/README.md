# Home page

The home page for this project is included in the repository. These pages don't entirely work, as the brand had to be censored. If you were to replace all instances of [brand] and [BRAND] with the correct file name of the new version, it would work.

The homepage is split into 10 snapshots. The homepage also hosts all versions of all SourceBase templates.
