as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Blocklist/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Blocklist
A curated blocklist for blocking certain content of mine when needed.

***

## About

See above. This blocklist project isfFor blocking sensitive projects of mine that are not appropriate in certain schools, businesses, countries, or territories, so you don't have to block the other 1000+ projects or worse, GitHub itself.

***

## Blocklist

This is the blocklist, as of August 6th 2021. You can view it separately [here](/Blocklist/BLOCKLIST.md) [Web link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Blocklist/blob/main/Blocklist/BLOCKLIST.md)

**Blocklist**

This is the main blocklist for this project. For now, there is no automated way of blocking, so it needs to be done manually. Luckily, there aren't too many projects that need to be blocked in certain areas.

Additionally, you may want to block the blocklist when you are done

<!--
YAMLAMLAMLAMLAMLAMALAMLAML...YAMLAMLAML...

A curated blocklist for blocking certain content of mine when needed.
!-->

**Note: this is not a full-fledged blocklist. I do not plan on maintaining one. There are many that exist, and I just need to compromise on some things for GitHub in certain countries, so I created a smaller blocklist.**

***

## TODO

- [x] Start the blocklist with a good starter selection

- [ ] Get more links for individual forks/block from the source

- [x] Add support for Gists

- [ ] Find any other projects that may have been missed.

**Total Progress:** `050.000%`

***

## Region notes

All projects listed above should be blocked in China due to Chinese Internet policies

Projects with sexual themes or humor should be blocked in countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.

These projects may need to be blocked for your school district or business/institution for safety and ethical reasons

You shouldn't block GitHub or my account altogether, that would be unfair, cruel censorship, and would make you look really bad. If you really have to, just block my account from your country (I recommend just blocking all the links above if you have to)

***

## Other notes

I don't block any users, I just ignore them if they bug me too much

***

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
