# Seanpm2001 GitHub Pages Collection documentation

## Development notes

### Ease of development / Hidden files

If GitHub allowed the upload of hidden files, this would be so much easier and I could have finished on the first day, instead of several hours across 8 days (for backing up GitHub pages site data)

Additionally, if I could upload more than 100 files at once, the backup part of this project would have been completed in less than an hour.
