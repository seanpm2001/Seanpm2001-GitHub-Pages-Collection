/* Project language file 4
* For: seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection
* About:
* I decided to make the 4th project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection) to be CSS, as CSS is the default secondary stylesheet language for this project. SCSS comes first. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. */
/* Now to make this a multi-purpose file, I will add styling for a basic dark mode template */
