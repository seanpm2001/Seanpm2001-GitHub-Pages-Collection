    <p>I decided to make HTTP the 20th project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection) as HTTP is one of the languages briefly used in some GitHub pages portions of this project, and I am representing all project languages today via project language files (2022, Tuesday, August 16th)</p>
