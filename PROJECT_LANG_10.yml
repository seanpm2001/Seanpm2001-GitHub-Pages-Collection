# Start of script
# Project language file 10
# For: seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection
# I chose YAML as the tenth project language for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection) as YAML is one of the primary configuration languages used on this project, and I am representing all project languages with project language files on this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
# This is an instance in which I am using YAML as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language, and I extended this to other languages, this time with YAML. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)
gitattributes: ".gitattributes"
line1: *.yml linguist-detectable=true
line2: *.yaml linguist-detectable=true
line3: *.yml linguist-language=YAML
line4: *.yaml linguist-language=YAML
