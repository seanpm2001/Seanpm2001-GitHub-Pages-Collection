# I chose Ruby as the seventh project language for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-GitHub-Pages-Collection) as Ruby is one of the primary scripting languages used on this project, and I am representing all project languages with project language files on this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
